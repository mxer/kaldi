# Speaker Apdation Training

* feature space vs model space
* Zousaisai recommand paper "Fast Adaptation of Deep Neural Network Based on Discriminant Codes of Speech Recognition"

## MLLR
* paper "Speaker Adaptation using Maximum Likelihood Linear Regression"
* u = Au, V = HVH

## MAP
* Bayes Estimation, u~(u0, v0)
